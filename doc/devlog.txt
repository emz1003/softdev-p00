Updated sitemap using dashed boxes to represent form action routes, changed database layout into three tables, and clarified search bar component

jackieL -- 2019-10-21 20:46
All joins match data from one table to match with rows in another, usually matching based
on IDs. They return a proper subset of every possible combination of rows between the two
tables. Inner join returns all the combinations where the clauses match exactly (most
exclusive join). Left join is slightly more inclusive because all rows from the left
table are automatically returned, even if they have no corresponding row in the second
table based on the ON condition. Cross-join is the subset of all possible combinations
between the rows of the two tables. If one table has M rows and the second has N rows,
cross-join returns M x N rows. Inner join will be helpful for our website when we either
want to match a blog entry or a blog to a blog or a user, respectively, when we are
retrieving information from the database to display on the "Search" page. Left join is
more useful for keeping track of the blogs or blog entries a user has, since a user may
not necessarily have any blogs and a blog may not necessarily have any entries. Cross join
s useful for returning all possible combinations, which might be useful if users are
trying to put the same content on every blog. Since cross join returns every possible
combination, it would easily copy over the same content. After reading and discussing
these join methods, we have made a slight edit to the design doc renaming one of the
columns in our database so that we can better implement the USING condition.

Response to Reading
1. If we figure out an error, communicate it. Don't be a dick by letting someone else turn all snowflakes into urine.
2. Incrementally develop and keep hoping the last thing we wrote is good enough to survive for a few hours so we can eat dinner and catch a nap.
