All joins match data from one table to match with rows in another, usually matching based on IDs. They return a proper subset of every possible combination of rows between the two tables. Inner join returns all the combinations where the clauses match exactly (most exclusive join). Left join is slightly more inclusive because all rows from the left table are automatically returned, even if they have no corresponding row in the second table based on the ON condition. Cross-join is the subset of all possible combinations between the rows of the two tables. If one table has M rows and the second has N rows, cross-join returns M x N rows. Inner join will be helpful for our website when we either want to match a blog entry or a blog to a blog or a user, respectively, when we are retrieving information from the database to display on the "Search" page. Left join is more useful for keeping track of the blogs or blog entries a user has, since a user may not necessarily have any blogs and a blog may not necessarily have any entries. Cross join is useful for returning all possible combinations, which might be useful if users are trying to put the same content on every blog. Since cross join returns every possible combination, it would easily copy over the same content. After reading and discussing these join methods, we have made a slight edit to the design doc renaming one of the columns in our database so that we can better implement the USING condition.
